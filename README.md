# HangingPostersCalculator
A MATLAB script to calculate the ideal height to hang a poster or picture frame

After measureing the dimensions of the wall and the frame, this script will calculate the height that the nail should be placed to hang the frame from.
The default places the height of the frame such that the line 1/3 from the top of the frame sits on the imaginary line 1/3 of the height below the ceiling.
Optionally the golden ratio can be used to calculate the placement, instead of the rule of thirds.
The position of the poster on the secion of wall will be plotted, to allow a visual preview before commiting to hammering the nail into the wall.

Future development: Plan to add support for defining multiple pictures in a cluster, with the hang line of the cluster aligned with the hang line on the wall.
